SqueezeNet is just a convolutional neural network (CNN), with an architecture chosen to have a small number of parameters and to require a minimal amount of computation. It's especially popular for folks that need to run CNNs on low-powered devices like cell phones and other internet-of-things devices. The MXNet Deep Learning framework offers SqueezeNet v1.0 and v1.1 that are pretrained on ImageNet through it's [model zoo](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/model_zoo.html).\n",

The hot dog is classified as not a hot dog, due to the fact that original model was trained on far more images of objects other than hot dogs. This is typically reffered to as a class imbalance problem. To improve the model we can download a set of new parameters for the model that we have pre-optimized through a \"fine tuning\" process, where we retrained the model using a more balanced set of images of hotdogs and other objects. We can then apply these new parameters to our model to make it even more accurate."
